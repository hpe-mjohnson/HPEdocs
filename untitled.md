# APPCLSTR \(Application Cluster Services\) Messages

I'm adding an xref to a graphic in another topic that's in a subfolder, for testing. Go to this graphic: [Connecting to the Integrity MC990 X system RMC and server BMC]().

Now an xref to a table in another topic: [Rack specifications](). Also a formal example [Our title for a formal example]() and a section [Including a title here because we want to test title in section]().

Now an xref to a table that's is another topic but not a topic that's in a subfolder: [No frame, using rowsep 1 and colsep 1 on table element](). Note that although the referenced table isn't in a subfolder, it's in a topic that has a resourceid element, so the file name comes from the resourceid rather than the id \(GUID\). Xref to section in same topic: [Other stuff]().

Testing cross-references to topics:

* [Sample admonitions]()
* [Processor options]()
* [ipv6 mld querier]()
* [Nonsensical task added for style testing]()

The table in this topic is here: [ACS Table]()

 NOTE:

Negative-numbered messages are common to most subsystems. If you receive a negative-numbered message that is not described in this chapter, see the chapter for messages that have the COM-KRNL subsystem ID.

## 1001 - Backup process created in CPU cpu-number

### Message Explanation

cpu-number : the number of the CPU on the local system in which the backup domain coordinator process was started.

**Cause**

The backup domain coordinator process was successfully created in the indicated CPU. This is a status message.

**Effect**

The backup domain coordinator process runs in the indicated CPU.

**Recovery**

Informational message only; no corrective action is needed.

## **1002**

1002 - Backup process creation in CPU cpu-number failed, error errnum, detail error-detail

### Message Explanation

cpu-number : the number of the CPU on the local system in which the backup domain coordinator process could not be started.

errnum : the process-creation error code returned by the PROCESS\_LAUNCH\_\(\) procedure.

error-detail : the process-creation error detail code returned by the PROCESS\_LAUNCH\_\(\) operation. If the value of this field is 0 \(zero\), the field is omitted from the message.

**Cause**

The domain coordinator process cannot create a backup process in the specified CPU on the local system because the PROCESS\_LAUNCH\_\(\) operation failed. This is a warning message.

**Effect**

The domain coordinator process runs as a single process.

**Recovery**

Correct the error condition. If the problem persists, contact your service provider.

For more detailed information, including recovery actions, refer to the _Guardian Procedure Errors and Messages Manual_.

## **1003**

1003 - Backup process in CPU cpu-number terminated abnormally, comp-code error-code, \[ stopper stopper-id, \] \[ term-ssid term-ssid, \] term-info term-info, \[ term-text term-text\]

### Message Explanation

cpu-number : the number of the CPU on the local system in which the backup domain coordinator process was terminated.

error-code : the completion code associated with the backup process termination. A completion code of -4 indicates that only the backup process, not both members of the process pair, terminated.

stopper-id : the process handle of the process that initiated the termination. This field is included only if the process was stopped externally.

term-ssid : the SPI subsystem identifier associated with the process-termination operation. This field is omitted if no subsystem identifier was associated with the termination.

term-info : the termination information code returned from the process-termination operation. If the value of this token is 0 \(zero\), the field is null and is omitted from the message. If the backup process was stopped externally \(indicated by completion code 6\), this field contains the creator user identifier of the external process that stopped the backup process.

term-text : the termination text associated with the process-termination operation. This field is omitted if no termination text was associated with the termination.

**Cause**

The backup domain coordinator process terminated unexpectedly. This is a warning message.

**Effect**

The primary domain coordinator process creates a new backup process.

**Cause**

A backup domain coordinator process terminated unexpectedly in the indicated CPU and the ACS subsystem processes in that CPU have not been restarted. This is a warning message.

**Effect**

The domain coordinator runs as a single process if the process was configured for a specific backup CPU when it was added. If the STARTUPMSG attribute specified a value of -1, the domain coordinator attempts to start a backup process in the next available CPU.

**Recovery**

Use the CONTROL ACS command to restart the ACS subsystem processes in the specified CPU.

**1067**

1067 - Invalid ACS product path actual-subvol - expecting system-subvol

## Message Explanation

actual-subvol : the name of the Guardian subvolume where the domain coordinator program resides.

system-subvol : the name of the Guardian subvolume that contains the OSIMAGE file used to load the system.

**Cause**

The domain coordinator program does not reside in the system subvolume used to load the system \($SYSTEM.SYSnn\). This is a fatal message.

**Effect**

The domain coordinator process terminates abnormally.

**Recovery**

Contact HPE support to install the ACS program files in $SYSTEM.SYSnn.

**1068**

1068 - Hometerm file-name is no longer valid for process process-name

## Message Explanation

file-name : the name of the home terminal.

process-name : the name of the process that could not be created.

**Cause**

The home terminal is no longer valid and cannot be used to create a backup domain coordinator process or other ACS subsystem process. This is an error message.

**Effect**

If the backup domain coordinator process fails, the primary domain coordinator process continues to run without a backup process. If one of the other ACS subsystem processes fails, the CPU where it was running is disabled.

**Recovery**

Restart the home terminal if possible. Otherwise, stop and restart the ACS subsystem with a new home terminal.

**1069**

Process pair for process-name is switching over

## Message Explanation

process-name : the name of the process pair.

**Cause**

The primary process can no longer continue. This is an informational message.

**Effect**

Primary process terminates and the backup process takes over.

**Recovery**

Informational message only; no corrective action is needed.

**1070**

Process pair for process-name cannot switch over

## Message Explanation

process-name : the name of the process pair.

**Cause**

The process pair cannot switch because no backup process is running. The backup-process CPU may be down or the ACS subsystem processes have not been restarted in that CPU.

**Effect**

The process pair cannot switch; ACS subsystem processes may not be available to handle requests.

**Recovery**

If the backup-process CPU is down, reload it. If the backup-process CPU is up, use the CONTROL command to restart the ACS subsystem processes.

**1071**

1071 - Primary process in CPU cpu-number terminated abnormally, comp-code comp-code, stopper stopper-id, term-ssid term-ssid, term-info term-info, term-text term-text

## Message Explanation

cpu-number : the number of the CPU on the local system in which the primary domain coordinator process was running.

comp-code : the completion code associated with the process-termination operation. A completion code of -4 indicates that only the primary process, not both members of the process pair, terminated.

stopper-id : the process handle of the process that stopped the primary process. This variable is included only if the process was stopped externally.

term-ssid : the subsystem identifier associated with the process termination. If no subsystem identifier was associated with the process termination, this variable is omitted.

term-info : the termination information code associated with the process termination. If the value of this field is 0 \(zero\), the field is omitted from the message. If the core process was stopped externally \(indicated by a completion code of 6\), this field contains the creator user identifier of the external process that initiated the termination.

term-text : the termination text associated with the process-termination operation. This field is omitted if no termination text was associated with the termination.

**Cause**

The primary domain coordinator process terminated abnormally. This is a warning message.

**Effect**

The backup domain coordinator process becomes the primary domain coordinator process and creates a new backup process.

**Recovery**

If the problem persists, contact your service provider.

**1072**

1072 - ACSCTL Parsing Status – error-info, file file-name, \[line line-number `]`

## Message Explanation

error-info : the description of the error in text format.

```text
Following are the error-info that are created or updated:

-   Summation of weights of PATHMONs in a pathway domain is not equal to 100 or the weight of one of the PATHMONs is not a value from 0 to 100.

-   PATHMON\(s\) added or deleted from the existing Pathway domain configuration.

-   REBALANCE-DOMAIN is not started as DOMAINLLBA is not set to WBLU.
```

file-name : the fully qualified file name of the ACSCTL file.

line-number : the line number in the ACSCTL file where the error is found. This field is not displayed for a status message.

**Cause**

The ACS subsystem provides the status information of the ACSCTL file parsing.

**Effect**

The ACSCTL file parsing error is logged as an error event. When this occurs, the ACSTCL file parsing fails and the status event is displayed.

**Recovery**

Correct the condition that caused the error and try the operation again.

**1073**

1073 - ACSCTL File Status – error-info, file file-name `, errno errnum`

## Message Explanation

error-info : the description of the error in text format.

file-name : the fully qualified file name of the ACSCTL file.

errnum : the error code returned by the system function fopen\(\).

**Cause**

The ACS subsystem provides the status information of the ACSCTL file.

**Effect**

The ACSCTL file error or status is logged.

**Recovery**

Correct the condition that caused the error and try the operation again.

**1074**

1074 - PATHMON pathmon-name was internally shut down,`code error-code`

## Message Explanation

Pathmon-name : the name of the PATHMON process being shutdown.

Error-code : the reason for internal shutdown. This is for internal use.

**Cause**

The ACS subsystem is closing the connection to the Pathmon process because:

* An I/O to the PATHMON process timed out.
* An I/O to the PATHMON process failed.
* ACS subsystem received unexpected message from PATHMON process.
* Local or remote PATHMON process processor is down.
* Node on which PATHMON process is running is unavailable.
* PATHMON process is unilaterally stopped or abended.

**Effect**

If the I/O operation was initiated in response to a send operation, the send operation fails with Pathsend error FESCPATHMONCONNECT and file-system error encountered during the I/O. The ACS subsystem closes communication to this PATHMON process, and then opens a new communication channel for future send requests.

**Recovery**

Informational message only; no corrective action is required.

**1076**
